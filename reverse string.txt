Given a string s, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving 
whitespace and initial word order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
Example 2:

Input: s = "Mr Ding"
Output: "rM gniD"

this code can handle any number of whitespace befor,between and after sentances

s="   Let's take LeetCode contest      "
print(s)
print(len(s))
point1=0
point2=0
s1=''
while point2<len(s):
    if s[point2]==' ' and point1<=point2:
        s1+=s[point1:point2][::-1]
        s1+=' '
        point1=point2
        while point1<len(s) and s[point1]== ' ':
            point1+=1
    else:
        if s[point2]==" ":
            s1+=' '
    point2+=1
s1+=s[point1:][::-1]
print(s1)   
print(len(s1))
